Kanbada!
Initially developed by: Fabio Catunda Marreco, fabio.marreco@gmail.com

This project is a simple kanban board for small teams inside the same network
with file sharing.

It works with a network share, everyone using the same file "sptint.xml".
When anyone changes the status of a given task, it is shared across developers.
